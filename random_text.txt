ok, my SAT prep app Educado AI is live on Google Playstore and soon on Apple App Store! 🎉

So, I am planning the complete Markeing Strategy for the launch (first month) and would love to get your inputs on it.
Help me with finding out the best marketing channels to promote the app, target audience.
I already have a good video creation team onboard to create promotional videos for the app.
Right now, we have Instagram Page of Educado AI (and also FB page), and we will be continuing posting there
We will also think of running ads on Instagram and FB. 
Initially we will try to create a stronger hold in bangalore and then expand to other cities, so target audience would be students in Bangalore who are preparing for SAT.

I want to also know about other platforms that I can target, my audeince is mostly teenagers (15-18 years old) and their parents.
I want to know about Google Ads, YouTube ads. 
Linkedin
X (formerly Twitter)
Reddit
Quora
Pinterest
Snapchat
Tiktok

Some other platforms like Mygate (app for gated communities, it allows ads) and similar apps.
There are some other channles like AdonMo (which has displays in societies and shows ads on screens in apartments, gyms etc)

What other platforms should I target for my app launch marketing? whichever allow ads and have good reach to teenagers and their parents.

Do a good research on these platforms, get me insights on each platform, how effective they are for app marketing, cost involved, targeting options available etc.


I want to give a Weekend homework to my team mates to get active on social medias:
